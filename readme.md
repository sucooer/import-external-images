## 🏆 TinyPNG API

- You must provide your own API key in the settings page.
- Free accounts allow up to 500 compressions per month.

## 🏷️ Image Naming

- Imported images are saved as `postID-index.extension` (e.g., `2313-1.jpg`, `2313-2.png`).
- This avoids filename conflicts and makes it easy to trace images to their source post.
